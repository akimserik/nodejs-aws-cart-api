# Docker Ignore File Explanations

This document explains why certain files and directories are included in the `.dockerignore` file.

1. **`node_modules`**: Dependencies will be installed inside the Docker container, so we exclude this folder to reduce the size of the build context.
2. **`dist`**: This folder contains the output of the build process and will be generated inside the Docker container.
3. **`cdk.out`**: This folder contains AWS CDK outputs and is not needed in the Docker context.
4. **`*.log`**: Log files are not needed in the Docker context.
5. **`*.ts`**: TypeScript source files are not needed after they are compiled.
6. **`*.map`**: Source map files are not needed in the Docker context.
7. **`.dockerignore`**: This file itself should be ignored to avoid including unnecessary files in the Docker context.
8. **`docker-compose.yml`**: Docker Compose configuration is not needed in the Docker context.
9. **`Dockerfile`**: The Dockerfile itself should be ignored to avoid including unnecessary files in the Docker context.
10. **`.env`**: Environment variables will be handled separately, so this file should be ignored.
11. **`.git`, `.gitignore`**: Git configuration files are not needed in the Docker context.
12. **`.vscode`, `.idea`**: IDE configuration files are not needed in the Docker context.
13. **`coverage`**: Code coverage reports are not needed in the Docker context.
14. **`test`**: Test files are not needed in the Docker context.
